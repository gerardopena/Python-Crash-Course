# Variables names can contain only letters, numbers and underscores. 
# They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number.
# For instance, you can call a variable message_1 but not 1_message.

# Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used to seperate words in variable names.
# For example, geeting_message works, but greet message will cause errors.

# Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names; that is, do not use words that Python has reserved for a particular programmatic purpose, such as the word print. 
# (See "Python Keywords and Built-in Functions" on page 471)

# Variable names should be short but descriptive. 
# For example, name is better than n, sutend_name is better than s_n, and name_length is better than length_of_persons_name.

# Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O because they could be confuse with the numbers 1 and 0
